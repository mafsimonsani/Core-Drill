# Core-Drill
Calculate the volume of a right circular cone

##### DMOPC '14 Contest 5 P1

Simon got a new drill recently. Everyone knows that a drill is shaped like a right circular cone. Simon knows his drill has radius r and height h. But now he wants to calculate the volume. Write a program to help Simon!

Input Specification

The first line of input will have an integer r (1 ≤ r ≤ 100). The second line of input will have an integer h (1 ≤ h ≤ 100).

Output Specification

The first line of output should have the volume of Simon's drill. The output will be accepted if it's within an absolute or relative error of 10-⁶.
